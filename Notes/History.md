# History

Java was originally designed in the early 1990s by a team of software engineers called the "Green Team" at Sun Microsystems. Their goal was to develop a programming language for digital devices such as set-top boxes and televisions. However, the technology was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time, and the project was eventually shelved.

The team then refocused on creating a new programming language that could be used for internet programming. The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". The team, led by James Gosling, designed Java to be a language that was easy to use, secure, and could run on any platform.

In 1995, Java was officially released and quickly gained popularity among developers. Netscape, one of the leading web browsers at the time, incorporated Java technology into its browser, which helped to further its popularity.

Java's popularity continued to grow over the years, and it became widely used for developing applications in various domains such as web development, mobile development, big data, and machine learning. James Gosling is known as the father of Java and is credited with creating one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

## Name origins

Why had they chose the name Java for Java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell, and fun to say.

According to James Gosling, "Java was one of the top choices along with Silk". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.

The birthplace of the initial coffee cultivation known as Java coffee is the Indonesian island of Java. This type of coffee is classified as an espresso bean. It was during a coffee break near his workplace that James Gosling decided to name his programming language "Java."

## Java releases

> for links and references https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history

<details>
<summary> JDK 1.0 and 1.1 (23rd Jan 1996) </summary>

This release included the Java runtime (the virtual machine and the class libraries), and the development tools (e.g., the Java compiler). Later, Sun also provided a runtime-only package, called the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The first name stuck, however, so usually people refer to a particular version of Java by its JDK version (e.g., JDK 1.0)

</details>

</br>

<details>
<summary> J2SE 1.2 (8th Dec 1998) </summary>

Introduced in 1998 as a quick fix to the former versions, version 1.2 was the start of a new beginning for Java. The JDKs of version 1.2 and later versions are often called Java 2 as well.
Major changes include:
- Rewrite the event handling (add Event Listeners)
- Change Thread synchronizations
- Introduction of the JIT-Just in time compilers
</details>

</br>

<details>
<summary> J2SE 1.3 Kestrel  (8th May 2000) </summary>

Released on 8 May 2000. The most notable changes were:

- HotSpot JVM included (the HotSpot JVM was first released in April, 1999 for the J2SE 1.2 JVM)
- RMI was modified to support optional compatibility with CORBA
- JavaSound
- Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) included in core libraries (previously available as an extension)
- Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA)
- Synthetic proxy classes

</details>

</br>

<details>
<summary> J2SE 1.4 Merlin (6th Feb 2002) </summary>

Java 1.4 has improved programmer productivity by expanding language features and available APIs:

- Assertion
- Regular Expression
- XML processing
- Cryptography and Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
- Non-blocking I/O (NIO)
- Logging

</details>

</br>

<details>
<summary> J2SE 5.0 Tiger  (30th Sep 2004) </summary>

Major changes include:
- Generics - Provides compile-time type safety for collections :and eliminates the drudgery of casting.
- Autoboxing/unboxing - Eliminates the drudgery of manual conversion between primitive types (such as int) and wrapper types (such as Integer).
- Enhanced for - Shorten the for loop with Collections use.
- Static imports - Lets you import all the static part of a class.
- Annotation/Metadata - Enabling tools to generate code and deployment descriptors from annotations in the source code. This leads to a "declarative" programming style where the programmer says what should be done and tools emit the code to do it. Annotations can be inspected through source parsing or by using the additional reflection APIs added in Java 5.
- JVM Improvements - Most of the run time library is now mapped into memory as a memory image, as opposed to being loaded from a series of class files. Large portion of the runtime libraries will now be shared among multiple JVM instances.

<details>
<summary> Java SE 6 Mustang (11th Dec 2006) </summary>

What's New in Java SE 6:

- Web Services - First-class support for writing XML web service client applications.
- Scripting - You can now mix in JavaScript technology source code, useful for prototyping. Also useful when you have teams with a variety of skill sets. More advanced developers can plug in their own scripting engines and mix their favorite scripting language in with Java code as they see fit.
- Database - No more need to find and configure your own JDBC database when developing a database application. Developers will also get the updated JDBC 4.0, a well-used API with many important improvements, such as special support for XML as an SQL datatype and better integration of Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs) and Character Large OBjects (CLOBs) into the APIs.
More Desktop APIs - GUI developers get a large number of new tricks to play like the ever popular yet newly incorporated SwingWorker utility to help you with threading in GUI apps, JTable sorting and filtering, and a new facility for quick splash screens to quiet impatient users.
Monitoring and Management - The really big deal here is that you don't need to do anything special to the startup to be able to attach on demand with any of the monitoring and management tools in the Java SE platform.
- Compiler Access - Really aimed at people who create tools for Java development and for frameworks like JavaServer Pages (JSP) or Personal Home Page construction kit (PHP) engines that need to generate a bunch of classes on demand, the compiler API opens up programmatic access to javac for in-process compilation of dynamically generated Java code. The compiler API is not directly intended for the everyday developer, but for those of you deafened by your screaming inner geek, roll up your sleeves and give it a try. And the rest of us will happily benefit from the tools and the improved Java frameworks that use this.
- Pluggable Annotations allows programmer to write annotation processor so that it can analyse your code semantically before javac compiles. For example, you could write an annotation processor that verifies whether your program obeys naming conventions.
- Desktop Deployment - At long last, Java SE 6 unifies the Java Plug-in technology and Java WebStart engines, which just makes sense. Installation of the Java WebStart application got a much needed makeover.
- Security - Java SE 6 has simplified the job of its security administrators by providing various new ways to access platform-native security services, such as native Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and cryptographic services on Microsoft Windows for secure authentication and communication, Java Generic Security Services (Java GSS) and Kerberos services for authentication, and access to LDAP servers for authenticating users.
- The -lities: Quality, Compatibility, Stability - Bug fixes ...

<details>
<summary> Java SE 8 Spider (18th Mar 2014) </summary>

Java 8 was released on 18 March 2014, and included some features that were planned for Java 7 but later deferred.

Work on features was organized in terms of JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs).

- JSR 335, JEP 126: Language-level support for lambda expressions (officially, lambda expressions; unofficially, closures) under Project Lambda which allow the addition of methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. There was an ongoing debate in the Java community on whether to add support for lambda expressions. Supporting lambda expressions also allows the performance of functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as MapReduce-inspired transformations on collections. Default methods allow an author of an API to add new methods to an interface without breaking the old code using it. Although it was not their primary intent, default methods also allow multiple inheritance of behavior (but not state).
- JSR 223, JEP 174: Project Nashorn, a JavaScript runtime which allows developers to embed JavaScript code within applications
- JSR 308, JEP 104: Annotation on Java Types
- Unsigned Integer Arithmetic
- JSR 337, JEP 120: Repeating annotations
- JSR 310, JEP 150: Date and Time API
- JEP 178: Statically-linked JNI libraries
- JEP 153: Launch JavaFX applications (direct launching of JavaFX application JARs)
- JEP 122: Remove the permanent generation

<summary> Java SE 9 (21st Sep 2017) </summary>

Java SE 9 was made available on September 21, 2017, due to controversial acceptance of the current implementation of Project Jigsaw by Java Executive Committee, which led Oracle to fix some open issues and concerns, and to refine some critical technical questions. In the last days of June 2017, Java Community Process expressed nearly unanimous consensus on the proposed Module System scheme.

- JSR 376: Modularization of the JDK under Project Jigsaw (Java Platform Module System)
- JavaDB was removed from JDK
- JEP 193: Variable handles, define a standard means to invoke the equivalents of various java.util.concurrent.atomic and sun.misc.Unsafe operations
- JEP 213: Milling Project Coin, allow @SafeVarargs on private instance methods; Allow effectively-final variables to be used as resources in the try-with-resources statement; Allow diamond with anonymous classes if the argument type of the inferred type is denotable; Complete the removal, begun in Java SE 8, of underscore from the set of legal identifier names; Support for private methods in interfaces
- JEP 222: jshell: The Java Shell (Read-Eval-Print Loop): JShell is a REPL command-line interface for the Java language.
- JEP 254: Compact Strings
- JEP 263: HiDPI graphics: automatic scaling and sizing
- JEP 266: More concurrency updates, it includes a Java implementation of Reactive Streams, including a new Flow class that included the interfaces previously provided by Reactive Streams
- JEP 268: XML catalogs
- JEP 282: jlink: The Java Linker, create a tool that can assemble and optimize a set of modules and their dependencies into a custom run-time image. It effectively allows to produce a fully usable executable including the JVM to run it
- JEP 295: Ahead-of-Time Compilation, ahead-of-time compilation provided by GraalVM

<details>
<summary> Java SE 15 (September 2020) </summary>

Java 15 adds e.g. support for multi-line string literals (aka Text Blocks). The Shenandoah and Z garbage collectors (latter sometimes abbreviated ZGC) are now ready for use in production (i.e. no longer marked experimental). Support for Oracle's Solaris operating system (and SPARC CPUs) is dropped (while still available in e.g. Java 11). The Nashorn JavaScript Engine is removed. Also removed some root CA certificates.

```java
package com.example.geometry;

public abstract sealed class Shape
    permits Circle, Rectangle, Square {...}
```

Together with records, sealed classes are sum types. They work well with other recent features like records, switch expressions, and pattern matching for instance-of. They all form part of a system for "Pattern matching in Java" first discussed by Gavin Bierman and Brian Goetz, in September 2018.

```java
record Rectangle(int x, int y, int w, int h) {}

int area(Object o) {
    if (o instanceof Rectangle(int x, int y, int w, int h)) {
        return w * h;
