# What are Data Types in Java?

Java is statically typed and also a strongly typed language because, in Java, each type of data (such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal, and so forth) is predefined as part of the programming language and all constants or variables defined for a given program must be described with one of the data types.

Data types in Java are of different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable that is made as per convenience and circumstances to cover up all test cases. Java has two categories in which data types are segregated 

1. **Primitive Data Type**: such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double
2. **Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type**: such as String, Array, etc.



## Primitive Data Types in Java

Primitive data are only single values and have no special capabilities.  There are 8 primitive data types. They are depicted below in tabular format below as follows:

| Type | Description | Default | Size | Example Literals | Range of Values |
| :--: |    :--:     |  :--:   | :--: |      :--:        |      :--:       |
| boolean | true or false | false | 1 bit | true, false | true, false |
| byte  | twos-complement integer | 0 | 8 bits | (none) | -128 to 127 |
| char  | Unicode character | \u0000 | 16 bits | ‘a’, ‘\u0041’, ‘\101’, '\\\\',‘\’, ‘\n’, ‘β’ | characters representation of ASCII values 0 to 255 |
| short | twos-complement integer | 0 | 16 bits | (none) | -32,768 to 32,767 |
| int | twos-complement integer | 0 | 32 bits | -2,-1,0,1,2 | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| long | twos-complement integer | 0 | 64 bits | -2L,-1L,0L,1L,2L | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| float | IEEE 754 floating point | 0.0 | 32 bits | 1.23e100f , -1.23e-100f , .3f ,3.14F | up to 7 decimal digits |
| double | IEEE 754 floating point | 0.0 | 64 bits | 1.23456e300d , -123456e-300d , 1e1d | upto 16 decimal digits |
